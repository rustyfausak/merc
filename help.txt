why are there 4 lines.. dist traveled should be linear_velocity * time. that doesnt quite work.
so i tried linear_velocity * ticks, which groups the lines pretty well. but each number of ticks
still has 4 lines associated with it. so in the graph, blue means 1 tick passed, green 2, red 3..
but there are still 4 "lines" for each of blue, green, red..

i cant accurately tween unless i can more accurately predict where someone/the ball will be..
